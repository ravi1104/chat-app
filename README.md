## Basic Task

In this assignment, the main goal was to create a simple chat application with the following features:

- Textbox to type messages
- Button to send messages
- Display chat messages above the textbox

Each message should have a randomly assigned username from a predefined list of users.

## Optional Stretch Goals

In addition to the basic functionality, the project also includes the following optional features:

1. **Emoji Options**: Users can include emojis in their chat messages. The application provides a selection of emojis to choose from.
   
2. **Mentions (@) Feature**: Users can mention other users in their messages by typing '@'. When '@' is typed, a list of users is displayed for selection.
